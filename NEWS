exquires 0.9.9
--------------

Version 1.0 is on the horizon, which will introduce a new system for updating
project databases. Version 0.9.9 is the last major release to use the old
system, and adds superior error handling and ratio parsing. A new option
(-a/--anchor) has also been added to exquires-correlate that sorts the Spearman
cross-correlation matrix based on the entries in the specified row/column.


exquires 0.9.8
--------------

Version 0.9.8 introduces options for computing fractional ranks, either
individually for each metric or averaged across all metrics, to
exquires-report. A new program, exquires-correlate, uses fractional ranks to
compute a Spearman's rank cross-correlation matrix.
