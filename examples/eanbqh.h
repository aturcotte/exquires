   * largest jj such that jj * n < j + 1. Using this caracterization
   * allows one to avoid integer divisions, and because by sweeping
   * through the jjs we know approximately what this index is, few
   * iterations are necessary. The key idea is as follows: whenever
   * the product of the next candidate jj by n initially fails the
